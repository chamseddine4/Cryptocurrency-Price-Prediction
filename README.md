# ðŸ“ˆ Crypto Price Forecasting with LSTM

This project forecasts cryptocurrency prices using multiple machine learning models and deep learning (LSTM) with 30-day ahead prediction. It consists of two Jupyter notebooks: one for detailed preprocessing and analysis, and one for final forecasting.

## ðŸ§  Project Structure

- `01_Data_Analysis_Preprocessing.ipynb`  
  Loads and explores data (from 04/12/2018 to 04/12/2024), visualizes trends, cleans, engineers features, and compares multiple models.

- `02_Crypto_Price_Forecasting.ipynb`  
  Uses the cleaned dataset and applies LSTM (most stable model), allowing flexible prediction for different cryptocurrencies.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- LSTM gave the most **stable and accurate** results (MSE ~0.0017)
- Fully modular: switch between models or assets easily
- Trained on full historical data and predicts 30 days ahead
